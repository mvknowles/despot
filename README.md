## Despot

This is a Python script to liberate your data from the once-great streaming
serice known as Spotify.

If you too think it's become a steaming pile, then feel free to dump your data
to JSON with this script.

You'll need a Spotify developer account.

Deezer is where it's at, if you want to remain lossless...

Usage:

```
python3 despot.py --client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
        --client-secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
        --save-dir=DESTINATION_DIRECTORY
```
